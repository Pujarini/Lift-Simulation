# Lift-Simulation
It is a web application where you can simulate web mechanics for a client.👤

# Requirements
  1. Have a page where you input the number of floors and lifts from the user 🏢
  2. An interactive UI is generated, where we have visual depictons of lifts and buttons on floors 0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣
  3. Upon clicking a particular button on the floor, a lift goes to that floor 🆙

  Create three major parts to your project:
   - Data store that contains the state of your application data
   - JS Engine that is the controller for which lift goes where
   - Dumb UI that responds to controller's commands

#Approaches :
✅1. Created the web application using only HTML, CSS, JS using normal css animations. It takes no user input.
🔜2. Create the web application using React. features : state management, dynamic according to user.
🔜3. Enhance the  look and feel of lift.
🔜4. use React hooks for state management and implement the same.
